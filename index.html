                            <p>Since the nineteenth century, thousands of cuneiform tablets dating
                                to the Old Babylonian Period (c. 1900-1700 BCE) have come to light
                                at various sites in ancient <a

                                mathematical tables, problems, and calculations. In the 1920s these
                                tablets began to be systematically studied by <a

                                    >Otto Neugebauer</a>, who spent two decades
                                transcribing and interpreting tablets housed in European and
                                American museums. His labors, and those of his associates, rivals,
                                and successors, have revealed a rich culture of mathematical
                                practice and education that flourished more than a thousand years
                                before the Greek sages <a

                                begin.</p>
                            <p>This exhibition is the first to explore the world of Old Babylonian
                                mathematics through cuneiform tablets covering the full spectrum of
                                mathematical activity, from arithmetical tables copied out by young
                                scribes-in-training to sophisticated work on topics that would now
                                be classified as number theory and algebra. The pioneering research
                                of Neugebauer and his contemporaries concentrated on the
                                mathematical content of the advanced texts; a selection of archival
                                manuscripts and correspondence offers a glimpse of Neugebauer's
                                research methods and his central role in this “heroic age.”</p>
                            <p>The cuneiform tablets illustrate three major themes: arithmetic
                                exploiting a notation of numbers based entirely on two basic
                                symbols; the scribal schools of <a
                                    onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;"
                                    href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/912910/" 
                                    >Nippur</a>; and advanced training. Many of the latter problems
                                were much more difficult than any that they would have to deal with
                                in professional scribal careers, and their solutions depended on
                                principles that, before the rediscovery of the Babylonian tablets,
                                were believed to have been discovered by the Greeks of the sixth
                                century BCE and after.</p>
